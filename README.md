Team Name: Team Biscuit Bulk
# Overview
This is the Github repo for our project; A barbering booking site. The website will provide use to both customers and the barber shop owner through an authority-based login system. On one end, the website will deal with payments from customers, allow customers to arrange or cancel haircuts and view upcoming appointments among other features. On the other side, the administrator will be able to cancel, reject or rearrange bookings with certain clients, change pricing, times and dates live on the website alongside other general administrative features. 

# Technologies
We plan on using the following technologies:
- React Framework + Bootstrap CSS
- Node.JS, Express
- MySQL

# Focuses
James will be working on the design of the site, and Jason will then develop the front-end based on these designs. Kieran will be focussing on the back-end development for the application, and also designing and implementing the databases for the site. Jason will also be looking at implementing a payment gateway into the site, and James will be working on converting the website into a mobile application.

# Updating the repo
Where possible, please do not commit directly to the main branch. Create your own branch, or use an exisiting one. This is to prevent any changes causing issues for others if they're working on the same files.
